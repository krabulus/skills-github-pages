Imagine cookies are like little notes that websites leave on your computer. These notes help the websites remember things about you, like your name or what you like to look at. Sometimes cookies are helpful because they make the websites work better for you. For example, they can remember your login details so you don't have to type them in every time.

But, just like not all notes are good, not all cookies are good either. Some cookies might track where you go on the internet and what you do there. That can feel a bit like someone following you around and watching everything you do online. So, while some cookies are okay, others might not be so nice. That's why it's important to keep an eye on them and sometimes clear them out if you don't want them hanging around.
